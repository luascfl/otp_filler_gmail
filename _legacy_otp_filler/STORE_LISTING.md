## Privacy Practices

### Single Purpose Description

This extension reads recent Gmail messages to extract one-time verification codes (OTP) and fills them into input fields on the active web page.

### Host Permission Justification

- `https://www.googleapis.com/*` — Required to call the Gmail API to fetch recent messages and extract verification codes.

### Permission Justifications

| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| `identity` | Required to authenticate with Google OAuth and obtain an access token for the Gmail API. |
| `storage` | Required to store linked Gmail account information and access tokens locally. |
| `activeTab` | Required to access the user's current tab when they click "Fill & Submit" so the verification code can be filled into the page. |
| `scripting` | Required to inject the content script on-demand into the active tab (only when the user clicks "Fill & Submit") to locate and fill the OTP input field. No scripts run on pages unless the user explicitly triggers it. |

### Data Usage Disclosure

- **Personally identifiable information:** Email address is collected and stored locally to manage linked accounts. It is not transmitted to any external server.
- **Authentication information:** OAuth access tokens are stored locally and used only to communicate with the Gmail API.
- **Email contents:** Email subject lines, snippets, and body text are read in-memory to extract verification codes. No email content is stored or transmitted externally.

This extension does not:
- Sell user data to third parties
- Transfer data for purposes unrelated to the extension's core functionality
- Use data for creditworthiness or lending purposes
